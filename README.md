# PowerCo Churn Analysis - BCG Data Science Job Simulation

This repository showcases the work done as part of the BCG Data Science Job Simulation, focusing on predicting customer churn for PowerCo. The goal was to analyze customer data, build a predictive model, and provide actionable insights.

## Key Tasks

1. **Client Data Identification**
   - Defined the data requirements for analyzing customer churn.
   - Identified relevant features such as customer demographics, account history, and service usage.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used Python for data visualization and performed EDA to uncover key patterns and trends in customer behavior.
   - Visualized data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore correlations, distributions, and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features based on domain knowledge to enhance the predictive model.
   - Applied techniques like encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating interaction terms where applicable.

4. **Churn Prediction Model**
   - Built a churn prediction model using XGBoost Classifier, a popular gradient boosting algorithm.
   - Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated model performance using metrics like F1-score to ensure robust predictions.

5. **Executive Summary**
   - Summarized key findings and insights from the analysis.
   - Delivered actionable recommendations for PowerCo to address customer churn based on the results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis and modeling.
- **XGBoost**: For building the predictive churn model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing trends and patterns in the data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results
- The churn prediction model achieved Accuracy of 99%	f1 score of 0.98.
- Key insights were provided to help PowerCo better understand and address customer churn.
